I'm currently working as a junior LLM researcher at Megvii Technology Limited , based in Beijing . Before joining the company, I received my master's degree at KIT in Germany and also spent less than a year at ETH Zurich in Switzerland conducting LLM research in the healthcare domain. Before all that, I spent four joyful years at Shandong University in China as an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering.
